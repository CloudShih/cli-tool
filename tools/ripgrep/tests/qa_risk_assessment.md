## Executive Summary

This document defines the risk assessment framework, success criteria, and quality gates for the Ripgrep plugin integration. It serves as the definitive guide for determining deployment readiness and maintaining professional software quality standards.

## Risk Assessment Framework

### Risk Categories

#### 1. Critical Risk Factors (Deployment Blockers)
- **Core Functionality Failures**: Search engine, result parsing, command building
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Path traversal, command injection, unsafe operations  
- **Data Integrity Issues**: Corrupted results, encoding problems, file handling errors
- **Memory Leaks**: Uncontrolled memory growth, resource exhaustion
- **Crash/Stability Issues**: Segmentation faults, unhandled exceptions, GUI freezes

#### 2. High Risk Factors (Requires Immediate Attention)
- **Performance Degradation**: >3s response times, >500MB memory usage
- **UI/UX Issues**: Non-responsive interface, accessibility failures, unusable workflows
- **Integration Problems**: Plugin loading failures, MVC communication breakdown
- **Cross-Platform Incompatibility**: Platform-specific failures, encoding issues

#### 3. Medium Risk Factors (Address Before Next Release)
- **Usability Limitations**: Confusing workflows, missing features, poor error messages
- **Performance Sub-optimization**: 1-3s response times, moderate memory usage
- **Theme/Visual Issues**: Broken layouts, poor contrast, scaling problems
- **Documentation Gaps**: Missing user guides, unclear error messages

#### 4. Low Risk Factors (Monitor and Improve)
- **Minor UI Inconsistencies**: Color variations, minor alignment issues
- **Performance Minor Issues**: <1s delays, minor memory usage
- **Feature Enhancement Opportunities**: Nice-to-have features, convenience improvements

### Risk Scoring Matrix

| Risk Level | Score Range | Deployment Decision |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Critical   | 90-100      | **BLOCKED** - Do not deploy |
| High       | 70-89       | **NOT READY** - Fix before deployment |
| Medium     | 40-69       | **CONDITIONAL** - Deploy with monitoring |
| Low        | 0-39        | **READY** - Safe to deploy |
